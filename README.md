		A UITableView displaying a list of items. The data in this list can be anything you want. At least twenty items must be in the list initially.
		A custom UITableView Cell that contains at least one UIImageView and two strings.
		An edit button that allows for the removal/deletion of any item in the list. The edit button changes the UITableView to edit mode and shows the minus button for deletion.
		When clicking on an item in the list, move to a second view with more information about this item.
		Create your own icon for this application and add it to your project
		Create your own launch image default.png and add it to your project.
